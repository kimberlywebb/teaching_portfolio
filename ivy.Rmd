**Term:** May 2022, May 2023    

</div>

\noindent
**Summit Description:** The Teaching Transformations Summit is a yearly gathering of graduate students across Ivy Plus institutions who are especially committed to improving the support, discourse, and practice of pedagogy in higher education. Each year, Cornell sends a select group to share teaching approaches and engage in a series of frank and generative discussions with colleagues at other institutions. The summit is a unique chance to form national connections with graduate students actively working to transform the academy through teaching development.
