## Tips for Carnegie Mellon students in statistics or psychology

- Get started in research through the [Dietrich College Research Training Program](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/students/undergraduate/programs/research-training-program.html)   
- Apply for [SURF](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/summer%20research%20fellowships/SURF/) and [SURG](https://www.cmu.edu/uro/research%20grants/SURG/index.html) grants with the help of a faculty mentor.    
- Take [36-315](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/academics/courselist): Statistical Graphics and Visualization.   
    + This was one of the most useful classes I took, both for interships and graduate school!   
    + Become familiar with [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), and [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) even if you do not take 36-315.     
- Write your name in [color](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf) on all your homework assignments so that you can find it quickly when professors hand homework back in a big pile at the end of class.     
- Make friends with a student a year or two above you in your program.
