<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
<p>As a statistics instructor, my goal is to prepare students to apply
quantitative skills to real-world problems. Teaching is not just about
showcasing a new topic in the classroom. Instead, it is about giving
students the skills they need to continue learning and using statistics
in their future classes and careers. I accomplish this goal of
<strong>instilling lifelong learning</strong> through an emphasis on
<strong>real-world examples, consistent in-class practice, and
transferable skills</strong>.</p>
<p> The field of statistics does not exist in a vacuum, and nor should a
class on statistics. In order for students to be able to use the skills
they gain in my classes in their future careers, they need to practice
selecting and deploying appropriate techniques and methods on
<strong>real-world problems</strong>. As a TA in computing labs for
graduate and undergraduate students, I accomplished this goal by helping
students develop exploratory data analysis and assumption checking
practices, using examples from public health disciplines. For instance,
after I introduce students to methods for paired samples
(i.e. Permutation tests, Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests), I ask them to
select the appropriate statistical test for a study of new clinical
guidelines on radiation dosages for lung cancer patients. We begin the
example with exploratory data analysis exercises, where students examine
distributions and summary statistics of clinic-average radiation doses
from before and after the introduction of new practice guidelines. They
answer questions that help them check the assumptions of the tests,
like: <em>Is the shape of the distribution of dosages constant across
time? What is the mean dosage before and after the change? What about
the median?</em> With intuition from the plots, students conclude that a
Wilcoxon Signed Rank test is <em>not</em> meaningful for their analysis,
as the median radiation dosage remains constant across the guideline
change, but the variance of the dosages narrows substantially. In the
future, if they struggle to identify the appropriate statistical method
for a problem at hand, they can repeat this exercise to explore their
data and verify the assumptions of a given analysis.</p>
<p>My practice of including real-world projects, examples, and datasets
in course material is complemented by my emphasis on <strong>consistent
in-class practice and feedback</strong>. In larger classes, I will
incorporate real-time practice and feedback with low-stakes iClicker and
PollEverywhere questions. For every new concept or learning outcome,
these formative assessments not only help students identify areas they
need to study, they also inform my lesson planning. I will be able to
adapt the amount of time I spend on concepts based on the results of
in-class quizzing. In smaller courses, I plan to implement in-class
practice in different ways. For example, in a course I have designed,
entitled <em>Statistical Graphics and Communication</em>, one of my
learning goals is for students to be able to verbally describe and
critique a statistical graphic from the media. When I teach this class,
I will scaffold this skill by providing students a graph from the media
each week, along with a standard set of guidelines for interpreting the
plot. During a lab or active learning session, I will pull aside a
sample of students, one at a time, to practice verbally presenting the
graph to me. This practice is deliberately low-stakes – students receive
credit for participating, and I provide feedback that helps them excel
on later presentations and summative assessments.</p>
<p>In the same way that frequent practice and feedback makes
expectations clear for students, my course organization makes the
<strong>transferability of statistical concepts</strong> clear for
students’ future careers. For example, I will not only state what the
learning goals are for my class, I will also explain <em>why</em> those
goals are important for professionals in a variety of fields.
Specifically, I will discuss how students can use course materials to
continue learning in an advanced course or show their knowledge to a
future employer. This practice helps students understand how their
learning experience can help them achieve their unique professional
goals. In my <em>Statistical Graphics and Communication</em> syllabus, I
connect the core components of the course, like lecture notes, lab
exams, and final projects, to the skills that students should have by
the end of the semester. Moreover, I emphasize tangible products that
students can take from the class and use in application materials,
including formal statistical reports, a research poster, and a web
application. I find that this transparency helps students understand the
importance of course topics and assignments, while providing clear
evidence of the transferability of classroom skills in future
careers.</p>
<p>In my classes, students are welcomed to data science concepts with
real-world examples, in-class problem-solving, and a clear appreciation
for the importance of what they are about to learn. These aspects of my
teaching promote lifelong learning in my students as they pursue their
own career goals and aspirations.</p>
<div id="commitment-to-teaching-excellence" class="section level3">
<h3>Commitment to Teaching Excellence</h3>
<p>To refine my own teaching approach and practices, I have engaged in
thorough pedagogical training at multiple institutions. While a student
at the University of Michigan, I took a course on <em>Effective Teaching
in Public Health</em>, which prepared me for my TA roles in introductory
biostatistics classes for graduate and undergraduate students. At
Cornell University, I have served as a Graduate Senior Lead Teaching
Fellow with the Center for Teaching Innovation (CTI) since 2021. In this
program, I reflected on my teaching practice through biannual teaching
training, biweekly teaching discussions, and periodic teaching
exercises. These experiences give me a toolkit to evaluate my own
teaching success, and to continue developing and refining my teaching
practice throughout my career.</p>
<p>I am also passionate about sharing teaching strategies and techniques
with my broader community. Through my work with the CTI, I currently
develop and facilitate multiple teaching workshops and conferences, with
a focus on graduate and post-doctoral level trainees. In addition,
through a competitive <em>Belonging at Cornell</em> grant, a colleague
and I developed an in-depth program for early-career graduate TAs at
Cornell, entitled the <em>Advanced Graduate Teaching Cohort</em>. As
part of the intensive, multiday program, I developed materials and
exercises on evidence-based inclusive teaching strategies, creating
high-structure classrooms, and further developing teaching strategies
for the cohort members. Given my prior experiences in the area of
teaching training, I welcome opportunities to mentor early-career
colleagues in their teaching development.</p>
</div>
<div id="teaching-experience-and-preparedness" class="section level3">
<h3>Teaching Experience and Preparedness</h3>
<p>At Cornell University, I served as a TA for multiple graduate and
undergraduate courses and led various TA development programs. I have
worked with class sizes between 15 and 125 students, and my teaching
modality has been both in-person and online (with both synchronous and
asynchronous components).</p>
<p>I am prepared to teach introductory statistics and data science
courses for undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In
addition, due to the nature of my research, I would also gladly teach
graduate courses on categorical data analysis, measurement error
methods, and statistical consulting and communication. My commitment to
teaching excellence and my past pedagogical training also prepares me to
teach pedagogy skills at the graduate and post-doctoral level, including
TA trainings. In addition, I look forward to teaching students through
research experiences.</p>
