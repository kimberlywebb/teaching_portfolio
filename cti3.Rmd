**Workshops created and facilitated:** "Steps to developing a strong workshop", "Roles and responsibilities of CTI Fellows", "Role of TAs in cultivating an inclusive classroom", "Effective grading and feedback", "Essentials of teaching: Peer review"

\noindent
**Sample materials:** I created a workshop on the "Roles and responsibilities of CTI Fellows" as part of the Fall 2023 CTI Fellows training. The workshop included a "jigsaw" group activity, where Fellows first learned about a new topic from a Lead Fellow, and then shared their knowledge with a new group. The jigsaw activity worksheet is provided below.
